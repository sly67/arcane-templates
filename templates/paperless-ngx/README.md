# Paperless NGX

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper.  Paperless-ngx forked from paperless-ng to continue the great work and distribute responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people. Consider joining us! Discussion of this transition can be found in issues #1599 and #1632.  A demo is available at demo.paperless-ngx.com using login demo / demo. Note: demo content is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded.
